# Python-OSRS-AIO-Magic

This project contains a teleport spam automation script for Old School RuneScape. The main script was originally named `EssayReview.pyw` to allow launching with `pythonw` on Windows so that no console window pops up. The script logs to an on-screen Tkinter overlay and doesn't strictly require a console.

If you prefer to run the script from the command line and see output in the terminal, you can use the `.py` extension and launch it with the standard `python` interpreter. The accompanying batch file `RunEssayReview.bat` assumes this behaviour and runs `python EssayReview.py`.
